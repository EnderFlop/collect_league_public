Collect League is a simple bot that allows you to collect League of Legends skins with your friends!

Every few minutes, Collect League will send a picture of a skin. The first person to type in the skin's name gets that champion! Use a variety of commands to see what champions you've collected, their skin lines, and more.

To collect a skin, simply type the name of the skin that appears. For example,

![Original Rammus](https://i.gyazo.com/ab8f314dcc56defc03b5ec78fba10038.png)

To collect Original Rammus here, simply type anything like "rammus" or "original Rammus". No commands or special formatting necessary!

Don't worry about things like capitals, "original", dashes, slashes, etc. The bot does the best it can to accept anything close to valid.
